# pp-tetris-attack

This is just an another personal project. I've wanted to code a game in C++ and focus more on gaining experience in C++ than spending time on design. So what's one of the greatest games in the universe? Tetris Attack on Super-Nintento (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack). It's my attempt on remaking the game.

## Libs

Code is using SFML library (https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

## Compile

If required libs are present code should compile after executing ./compile-and-run.sh.
